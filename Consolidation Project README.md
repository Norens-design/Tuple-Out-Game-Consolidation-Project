# Manual for the Tuple_Out_Dice_Game_Consolidation - and please don't tuple out

# Premise and purpose of this program:

More advice on why you shouldn't "tuple out" in a moment.

This code runs a dice game seen through the lens of two different players. 

Consider this version 1.0. This part of the game is designed for people with limited experience in a real-life dice game or people recreationally interested in seeing how an ordinary dice game is mimicked by a computer.

Future versions (2.0, 3.0, and so on will be similar to your software update notices that you get in Google,Opera, Microsoft Edge, or even Linux if you use any of those.) 

Those versions will add new players, allow you to insert yourself as a participant, allow you to test out different combinational sets of 3 numbers, like the randomness of 3 three-dimensional dice cubes in a single live roll, earn confetti after a victory, and communicate with the game through your input to feel deep in the action. 

Those versions will find you or you will find them once you get really comfortable with how a standard dice game is played. For now, though...

# Installation Details About Version 1.0 of the Tuple_Out_Dice_Game_Consolidation:

Open provided text in Visual Studio Code or your browser setting's developer environment terminal.

# Next steps:
Find the introductions for the two existing players. They should say, "Hello (insert name), you will roll first (or 'after each of aforementioned player's turns')." But, the name is not addressing you directly yet. It mentions two people imagined for this game. 

Watch in your terminal as the code rolls dice, with a few example combinations of three dice outcomes given in the program. 

One type of outcome will have each player earning up to 10 points or higher per turn, but nothing reaches up to 20 or 30 points altogether yet. Totals added from each roll of 3 dice per player are not introduced until the next upcoming versions. 

This game thinks turn-by-turn. 

Basically, it pretends to have the memory of a goldfish - myth or fact of that figure of speech is debated but funnily irrelevant - and considers the players' status by each roll separately - at that moment. Nevertheless, this keeps things a bit interesting. Don't you think? 

Then, things will alternate and...well, you have to see for yourself. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just be aware that, in future updates of the game, getting the same number for all 3 dice when it is your turn if you have rolled that number twice during your previous turn will lead to a loss of the game to your opponent. That is the "tuple out" if it happens before your opponent can suffer a similar fate, leaving them with more points than you, even if by 2 points only. 

Plus, this current 1.0 game deducts 2 points of the points earned with each number added in the three dice rolled per turn if there are fixed dice - that's a roll that yields the same number repeated 2/3 dice. That number must be avoided or not rolled in all 3 dice the next turn the player gets. Same point as previous paragraph.

Have fun! That is the biggest rule in gaming.
