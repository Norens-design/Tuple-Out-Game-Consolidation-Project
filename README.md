# Manual for the Tuple_Out_Dice_Game_Consolidation - and please don't tuple out

# Premise and purpose of this program:

More advice on why you shouldn't "tuple out" in a moment.

This code runs a dice game seen through the lens of two different players. 

Consider this version 1.0. This part of the game is designed for people with limited experience in a real-life dice game or people recreationally interested in seeing how an ordinary dice game is mimicked by a computer.

Future versions (2.0, 3.0, and so on will be similar to your software update notices that you get in Google,Opera, Microsoft Edge, or even Linux if you use any of those.) 

Those versions will add new players, allow you to insert yourself as a participant, allow you to test out different sets of 3 numbers, like 3 dice in a single roll, earn confetti after a victory, and communicate with the game to feel deep in the action. 

Those versions will find you or you will find them once you get really comfortable with how a standard dice game
is played.

# Installation Details About Version 1.0 of the Tuple_Out_Dice_Game_Consolidation:

Open provided text in Visual Studio Code or your browser setting's developer environment terminal.

# Next steps:
Find the introductions for the two set players. They should say, "Hello (insert name), you will roll first." But, the name is not addressing you directly yet. It mentions two people imagined for this game.

Watch in your terminal as the code rolls dice, with a few example combinations of three dice outcomes given in the program. 

One type of outcome will have each player earning more than one point. 

Then, things will alternate and...you have to see for yourself. Just know that getting the same number for all 3 dice when it is your turn will lead to a loss of the game to your opponent. That is the "tuple out" if it happens before your opponent can suffer a similar fate, leaving them with more points than you, even if by 1 point only.

Have fun! That is the big rule.

**Big Version Update** 
There is now a Tuple-Out-Game-Consolidation-Project 2.0 as promised. In this version, you can enter yourself into the game. No more letting Sofia and Fatima have all the fun. Simply enter your name when promoted by the code and you will be warmly greeted. 

Prior to that, there will be a simple "coin toss' held to decide who goes first. If you are playing by yourself, you are both "you" and "the other player", so win-win before you even play any game. 

Once let in, you should be able to roll dice and get three numbers at a time at random as Sophia and Fatima were shown to have done earlier.

This guide is incomplete unless there is talk of a new fun feature to let you see your score data as a table; it is currently in beta testing. You will see an analysis for Sophia and Fatima before the launch of the ones designed to assess your results and customize their findings according to your situation as you roll. Right now, work is underway to refine this feature before you get an analysis/overview of your game stats. Keep looking forward to bigger and brighter versions soon!

Also, there is a time slowing of the demo lines introduced to allow you to process it all before you go off on your own adventures.
